This is my 1st GIT project and was having fun forking ihannes's sudoku project and generalized it ( the box size can be 4x4, 9x9 or 16x16). 

You need maven and java to build this project.

To run some of the test data in 9x9 format. please use the following:

java -jar target/sudoku-kata-1.0.jar ./puzzles.txt 
java -jar target/sudoku-kata-1.0.jar ./puzzles2.txt 
java -jar target/sudoku-kata-1.0.jar ./puzzles3.txt 

please see original project for details at http://github.com/jhannes/sudoku-kata/commits/commit_per_test/ or click on the fork project.
